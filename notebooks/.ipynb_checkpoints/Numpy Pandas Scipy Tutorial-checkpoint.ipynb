    ".loc is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. .loc will raise KeyError when the items are not found. Allowed inputs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single label, e.g. 5 or 'a', (note that 5 is interpreted as a label of the index. This use is not an integer position along the index)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list or array of labels ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",

    "- A boolean array\n",
    "\n",
    "- A callable function with one argument (the calling Series, DataFrame or Panel) and that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above)\n",
    "\n",
    ".iloc is primarily integer position based (from 0 to length-1 of the axis), but may also be used with a boolean array. .iloc will raise IndexError if a requested indexer is out-of-bounds, except slice indexers which allow out-of-bounds indexing. (this conforms with python/numpy slice semantics). Allowed inputs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An integer e.g. 5\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list or array of integers [4, 3, 0]\n",

    "- A callable function with one argument (the calling Series, DataFrame or Panel) and that returns valid output for indexing (one of the above)\n",
    "\n",
    ".ix supports mixed integer and label based access. It is primarily label based, but will fall back to integer positional access unless the corresponding axis is of integer type. .ix is the most general and will support any of the inputs in .loc and .iloc. .ix also supports floating point label schemes. .ix is exceptionally useful when dealing with mixed positional and label based hierarchical indexes.\n",
