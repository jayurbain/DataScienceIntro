    "\n",
    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent development of research standards for low back pain (NIH LBP taskforce reference) creates an opportunity for prospective data standardization. Ultimately, the goal of this standardized data collection is to better understand patterns for treatment response and build predictive care models. While the impact of aggregate data will depend on large-scale integration, the focus of this study is to better understand the relationship and predictive ability of the survey variables, specifically examining predictors of opioid use. \n",
    "Clinical research is evolving to reflect the need for efficient clinical trial design and data collection, which is reflected by the move toward improved data standardization. A key component of this is adaptive statistical designs and analysis methods. The expert consensus panel developed the NIH task force for research standards questionnaire (LBPTF) to overcome common research barriers while addressing the underlying key clinical questions for low back pain. Specifically, it shifted the focus from anatomic or pathophysiological classification to that of pain interference, functional status, and pain intensity. This focused questionnaire measures these domains using several short forms from PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System).\n",
    "\n",
    "The novel organizational framework of the LBPTF questionnaire incorporates key clinical self-report measures as well as information about co-morbid conditions, demographic information, and treatment history. Understanding the co-occurence patterns of these data may provide insight into more focused data collection as well as build toward predictive modeling. The inherent limitations of self-reported data are mitigated by the extensive development of the minimum data set variables to incorporate key perceived domains of influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building from this perspective, the objective of this pilot survey was to deconstruct and analyze the inter-relationship of these variables in a way that will provide more meaningful analysis of these data moving forward. Statistical analysis and interpretation can be misleading due to inherent data assumptions, but with the data points selected by expert consensus, this minimum dataset represents the starting point for analyzing these relationships. Recognizing the limitations of a survey snapshot, we planned iterative analyses of a pilot survey obtained during the LBPTF with several statistical and machine learning methods to validate our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed a preliminary statistical analysis of the back pain dateset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 200-sample dataset, Opioid use negatively affects the population distribution for physical function, physical interference, and pain intensity. All of these results are statistically significant (*p* << 0.05*) using Pearson's $\\chi^2$ (Chi-squared) goodness of fit statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and recursive feature elimination for identifying the most predictive features in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using all features and 10-fold cross-validation, our predictive accuracies are *0.69, 0.63, and 0.58* for LR, SVM, and DT respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the top 10 features identified using recursive feature elimination for each classifier and 10-fold cross-validation, our predictive accuracies improvei modestly to *0.71, 0.66, and 0.66* for LR, SVM, and DT respectively."

Even if the total sample size is very large, the fact that state counts are done conditionally for each parents configuration causes immense fragmentation. If a variable has 3 parents that can each take 10 states, then state counts will be done seperately for `10^3 = 1000` parents configurations.

    "To learn model structure (a DAG) from a data set, there are two broad techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    " - score-based structure learning\n",
    " - constraint-based structure learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of both techniques allows further improvement:\n",
    " - hybrid structure learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Score-based Structure Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach construes model selection as an optimization task. It has two building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A _scoring function_ $s_D\\colon M \\to \\mathbb R$ that maps models to a numerical score, based on how well they fit to a given data set $D$.\n",
    "- A _search strategy_ to traverse the search space of possible models $M$ and select a model with optimal score.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Scoring functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used scores to measure the fit between model and data are _Bayesian Dirichlet scores_ such as *BDeu* or *K2* and the _Bayesian Information Criterion_ (BIC, also called MDL). See [1], Section 18.3 for a detailed introduction on scores. As before, BDeu is dependent on an equivalent sample size."

For more information about the individual functions see their docstring documentation. If you used pgmpy's structure learning features to satisfactorily learn a non-trivial network from real data, feel free to drop us an eMail via the mailing list or just open a Github issue. We'd like to put your network in the examples-section!\n",
