    "The basic workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build** a DataFrame from the data (ideally, put all data in this object)\n",
    "2. **Clean** the DataFrame. It should have the following properties:\n",
    "    - Each row describes a single object\n",
    "    - Each column describes a property of that object\n",
    "    - Columns are numeric whenever appropriate\n",
    "    - Columns contain atomic properties that cannot be further decomposed\n",
    "3. Explore **global properties**. Use histograms, scatter plots, and aggregation functions to summarize the data.\n",
    "4. Explore **group properties**. Use groupby and small multiples to compare subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process transforms your data into a format which is easier to work with, gives you a basic overview of the data's properties, and likely generates several questions for you to followup in subsequent analysis.\n",

    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent development of research standards for low back pain (NIH LBP taskforce reference) creates an opportunity for prospective data standardization. Ultimately, the goal of this standardized data collection is to better understand patterns for treatment response and build predictive care models. While the impact of aggregate data will depend on large-scale integration, the focus of this study is to better understand the relationship and predictive ability of the survey variables, specifically examining predictors of opioid use. \n",
    "Clinical research is evolving to reflect the need for efficient clinical trial design and data collection, which is reflected by the move toward improved data standardization. A key component of this is adaptive statistical designs and analysis methods. The expert consensus panel developed the NIH task force for research standards questionnaire (LBPTF) to overcome common research barriers while addressing the underlying key clinical questions for low back pain. Specifically, it shifted the focus from anatomic or pathophysiological classification to that of pain interference, functional status, and pain intensity. This focused questionnaire measures these domains using several short forms from PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System).\n",
    "\n",
    "The novel organizational framework of the LBPTF questionnaire incorporates key clinical self-report measures as well as information about co-morbid conditions, demographic information, and treatment history. Understanding the co-occurence patterns of these data may provide insight into more focused data collection as well as build toward predictive modeling. The inherent limitations of self-reported data are mitigated by the extensive development of the minimum data set variables to incorporate key perceived domains of influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building from this perspective, the objective of this pilot survey was to deconstruct and analyze the inter-relationship of these variables in a way that will provide more meaningful analysis of these data moving forward. Statistical analysis and interpretation can be misleading due to inherent data assumptions, but with the data points selected by expert consensus, this minimum dataset represents the starting point for analyzing these relationships. Recognizing the limitations of a survey snapshot, we planned iterative analyses of a pilot survey obtained during the LBPTF with several statistical and machine learning methods to validate our approach.\n",
